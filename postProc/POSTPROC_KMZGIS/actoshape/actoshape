# most cases it will work as written, with no modifications, as long
# as the file "actoshape-actoshape-1.0.5.jar" is in the same directory where this
# script is.
#
# If you want to install this script in some directory other than the
# one containing actoshape-actoshape-1.0.5.jar, or if for some other reason this
# script isn't able to find actoshape-actoshape-1.0.5.jar when you run it, change the
# following line to reference the full pathname of the directory
# containing actoshape-actoshape-1.0.5.jar, and remove the comment character from the
# beginning of the line:
# :ACTOSHAPE_HOME=/home/ptaeb/asgs-2014stable/Aug2016/output/POSTPROC_KMZGIS/actoshape/actoshape-actoshape-1.0.5.jar
